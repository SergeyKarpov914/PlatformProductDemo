# React Application based on Platform-Product Solution Architecture

This React application was put together as a Demo project illustrating the 'Full Stack' capability of the Platform-Product Solution Architecture. Using exeiting API server, a JavaScript front-end was created in couple of days. This front-end displays the five Domain data collections stored in a SQL Server database. 

https://github.com/SergeyKarpov914/PlatformProductDemo/blob/master/README.md

This Platform-Product module diagram shows a combination of 2 products: API Server and React web application, built using the Platform:

The API Server needs to be built and stated first.

The React front-end web application is based on an open source template: : https://www.wrappixel.com/templates/free-material-ui-template/

To build and run it you have to use two scripts:

### `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
### `npm run start`

After which, the application should look like this:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
